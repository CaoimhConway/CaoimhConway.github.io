# Data science portfolio by Caoimh Conway

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## [Investigating Food Safety Data](https://github.com/CaoimhConway/InvestigatingFoodSafetyData/blob/master/Investigating%20Food%20Safety%20Data.ipynb)

In this notebook I examine data collected by the Department of Public Health in San Francisco, and demonstrate multiple methods for data manipulation, visualization, imputation, and representation. I also investigate patterns that appear in the data, and what insights we can glean from the distributions in the dataset.
