# Data science portfolio by Caoimh Conway

This portfolio contains a series of data analyses, visualizations, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models that I have created.


## [Neural Network Flexibility](https://github.com/CaoimhConway/NeuralNetworkFlexibility)

I created this project to demonstrate the flexibility of neural networks in **Python** by using the same neural network to identify hand written digits, identify the language of a text, construct a perceptron, and to model real number functions, such as sin(x).


## [Double Ended Queue](https://github.com/CaoimhConway/DoubleEndedQueue)
This is a **Java** implementation of a double ended queue, which is usually referred to by its irregular acronym, Deque (pronounced "Deck").  Deques are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back). 

## [Investigating Food Safety Data](https://hub-binder.mybinder.ovh/user/caoimhconway-in-gfoodsafetydata-095hg3q0/notebooks/Investigating%20Food%20Safety%20Data.ipynb)
### [Noninteractive copy](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CaoimhConway/InvestigatingFoodSafetyData/blob/master/Investigating%20Food%20Safety%20Data.ipynb)  ### [Github repo](https://github.com/CaoimhConway/InvestigatingFoodSafetyData)

In this notebook I examine data collected by the Department of Public Health in San Francisco, and demonstrate multiple methods for data manipulation, visualization, imputation, and representation in **Python**. I also investigate patterns that appear in the data, and what insights we can glean from the distributions in the dataset.
